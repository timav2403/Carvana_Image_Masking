# Carvana Segmentation
The challenge in this project was to remove the background of the image and provide the image of car only. The goal for this problem is utilizing the car image to superimpose over any background for advertisement. 
# Data
The dataset encompasses several differnt make, model, and years of cars and of each car 16 different views are provided. Masks are provided for each view of the car for validation of the background removal. 

Image of car:
